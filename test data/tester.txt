Dear Capital One Cardholder,

During our regularly scheduled account maintenance and verification procedures, we have detected a slight error regarding your Capital One Card(s).

This might be due to one of the following reasons:

1. A recent change in your personal information (i.e. address changing) 2. Submitting invalid information during the initial sign up process.
4. Multiple failed logins in your account.
3. An inability to accurately verify your selected option of payment due to an internal error within our system.

Please update and verify your information by clicking the following link:

Note: You must verify your information before you can continue using your card.

Thank you,
Capital One.

The "usc.edu" domain in the "From" address is a give away that this is a phishing scam.  Also the link to the Capital One website is most likely fake.
